<h4> Founder</h4>
<p>The founder Director is Mr Jainos Kusotera. He is a holder of a Bachelor of Education Degree(Special Needs). He has a wealthy experience in the teaching fraternity. He has been working in the field for 22 years and has worked in South Africa for a good number of years before coming to Zimbabwe to fulfill his ambition of establishing a learning institution. The passion grew when he observed that a lot of less privileged children were not affording to go to school and with his little earnings from his own investments he decided to help them. He set up the school in September 2021 and officially registered it in February 2022
